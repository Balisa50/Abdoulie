#### SaaS Economics by Tier

**Essential Customer:**
- Monthly fee: $2,500 × 12 = $30,000/year
- Assumed freight spend: $2M/year
- Typical savings: 2.5% error recovery = $50,000/year
- Customer ROI: 5.9x (saves $50K, pays $30K = $20K net savings)
- Gross margin to Tesseract: 75% ($22,500)
- Payback period: 1.8 months
- LTV (3-year retention): $90,000 (ARR × 3)

**Professional Customer:**
- Monthly fee: $6,000 × 12 = $72,000/year
- Assumed freight spend: $5M/year
- Typical savings: 2.5% error recovery = $125,000/year
- Customer ROI: 4.7x (saves $125K, pays $72K = $53K net savings)
- Gross margin to Tesseract: 75% ($54,000)
- Payback period: 1.9 months
- LTV (3-year retention): $216,000

**Enterprise Customer:**
- Monthly fee: $15,000 × 12 = $180,000/year
- Assumed freight spend: $25M/year
- Typical savings: 2.5% error recovery = $625,000/year
- Customer ROI: 6.5x (saves $625K, pays $180K = $445K net savings)
- Gross margin to Tesseract: 75% ($135,000)
- Payback period: 1.7 months
- LTV (3-year retention): $540,000

#### Transition Strategy: Contingency → SaaS

**Month 6 Conversion Program:**

1. **Offer Terms for Existing Contingency Customers:**
   - Convert contingency to 12-month SaaS subscription
   - **Discount:** 20% off first year SaaS pricing
   - **Guarantee:** Money-back if savings <2× subscription cost
   - **Flexibility:** Option to stay on contingency (grandfather clause)

2. **Calculation Example:**
   - Current contingency fee: $43,750/year (35% of $125K recovery)
   - Standard SaaS price (Professional): $72,000/year
   - 20% discount: $57,600/year
   - **Savings message:** "Save $14,150/year ($43.75K → $57.6K) by locking in subscription"
   - **But wait:** That's an increase! Reframe: "Predictable pricing + 50% recovery capture" vs. "50% recovery only on disputed amounts"

3. **Better Conversion Messaging:**
   - Contingency model: You only pay when we recover money (risk-free)
   - SaaS model: You pay us monthly regardless, but you capture 100% of additional savings we find
   - **The switch:** After Month 6, customers will have proven the model works. Offer subscription at a rate where they break even or benefit if they trust your continued performance.

   **Adjusted Offer (Month 6):**
   - Customer currently receives: 65% of $125K = $81,250/year in net savings
   - Tesseract receives: 35% of $125K = $43,750/year
   - **Proposed SaaS:** $45,000/year (new "Proven Performer" pricing)
   - Customer captures: $80,000/year (savings minus subscription)
   - Tesseract captures: $45,000/year (predictable, higher margin)
   - **Benefit:** Customer saves $1,250, Tesseract gets predictable $1,250/month

  ACME Freight Audit - 90-Day Final Results
  
  SUMMARY
  Invoices Processed: 947 (487 historical + 460 new)
  Total Errors Found: 47
  Total Recovery Potential: $17,500
  
  RESULTS SO FAR
  Disputes Submitted: 12
  Disputes Won (carrier approved): 9
  Total Recovered (received): $7,850
  Average time to resolution: 35 days
  Win rate: 75%
  
  FINANCIAL IMPACT
  ACME Annual Run Rate: 47 errors × 12 = 564 errors/year
  Annual recovery potential: ~$35,000
  Annual cost (if continued with contingency): $12,250 (35% fee)
  Annual savings to ACME: $22,750
  
  TOP ERRORS
  1. Fuel Surcharge Misapplication: 18 errors, $5,200
  2. Rate Overcharges: 15 errors, $4,800
  3. Unauthorized Accessories: 10 errors, $4,200
  4. Duplicate Invoices: 4 errors, $3,300
  
  NEXT STEPS
  - Convert to paid engagement
  - Move from weekly email to dashboard-based alerts
  - (Optional) Set up API integration with your freight system
  
  Recommended plan: Professional SaaS plan @ $6,000/month = $72,000/year
  vs. Contingency @ 35% = $12,250/year
  
  My suggestion: Stick with contingency for now (proven track record), 
  revisit SaaS after 12 months when you're confident in the model.
  ```
  - Attachment: Full error list, dispute history, carriers by error

- **Case Study Development (Weeks 9-10)**
  - Propose case study: "Can we use your story publicly?"
  - Interview Sarah (30 min): "Before ACME adopted Tesseract, you were manually auditing. What was that process like? How many invoices could your team audit per month?"
  - Testimonial request: "In 2-3 sentences, what's been the impact of Tesseract?"
  - Approval: Sarah approves before publishing
  - Deliverable: 1-page case study with:
    - Problem statement (ACME's manual audit process)
    - Solution (Tesseract automation)
    - Results (found $35K+ potential)
    - Sarah's testimonial

- **Conversion Meeting (Week 11, 1 hour)**
  - Attendees: Sarah (CFO), Tesseract sales + product
  - Agenda:
    1. Review 90-day results + win rate (75%)
    2. Project annual impact ($35K recovery potential)
    3. Pricing options:
       - **Contingency (default):** 35% of recoveries = ~$12K/year
       - **Professional SaaS:** $6K/month = $72K/year (but you capture 100% of new savings)
    4. Next steps: "Let's move forward. Which model works better for your budget?"
  - Likely outcome: ACME chooses contingency (lower risk, proven model)
  - Contract: 12-month contingency agreement

### Pilot Economics Summary

**Cost to Run 1 Pilot:**
- Sales time (discovery + calls): 8 hours @ $150/hr = $1,200
- Product/engineering (setup + customization): 12 hours @ $100/hr = $1,200
- Free audit (processing costs): $200
- Discount on recoveries (waived $25K × 35%): $8,750
- **Total cost: ~$11,350**

**Value Generated:**
- Data for 2-3 case studies: $5,000 (marketing value)
- Feedback for product roadmap: $3,000 (engineering value)
- Contract value (if converts): $40,000/year × 3 years = $120,000 LTV
- **Net value: $108,650** (massive positive ROI)

**Alternative cost-effective model (scaled):**
- Reduce manual customization (implement self-serve onboarding)
- Reduce free audit discount (waive $10K instead of $25K) = -$5,250
- **Revised pilot cost: ~$6,100**
- **Revised ROI: $102,900 LTV / $6,100 cost = 16.9x**

## PART 3: SALES DECK - 5 KEY SECTIONS

### Overview

This deck is designed for the first sales conversation with prospects. Target: 10-15 minutes of talking, heavy visual support, ending with a clear call-to-action ("Get Your Instant Audit").

The "Instant Audit" wedge is the lead—it's the thing that gets people to say "yes" to the first meeting with minimal friction.

---

### SLIDE 1: The Problem Hook

**Title:** "Freight Invoices Are Bleeding Your Profits—And You Don't Even Know It"

**Headline Stat:**
- "8-15% of freight invoices contain errors" — CSCMP Annual Report
- Average mid-market company ($5M freight spend): **$500,000 in annual overcharges**

**Supporting Bullets:**
- ❌ Manual audit takes 30+ days (vs. industry need: real-time)
- ❌ Catches only 30-40% of errors (vs. industry best: 90%+)
- ❌ Costs 50% contingency (vs. Tesseract: 30-35%)
- ❌ Most companies audit <10% of invoices (too expensive, too slow)

**Visuals:**

  ✗ Overcharges (35%)
  ✗ Duplicate invoices (15%)
  ✗ Unauthorized charges (25%)
  ✗ Fuel surcharge errors (20%)
  ✗ Weight discrepancies (5%)
  ```
- Right side: Impact calculation
  ```
  Your Situation (estimated):
  Annual freight spend: $5M
  Industry error rate: 10%
  Undetected overcharges: $500,000/year
  
  If you recovered that: Worth $150K-250K in pure savings
  ```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Most CFOs we talk to are shocked when we show them this. They assume their carriers are honest, but the data shows 1 in 10 invoices has an error. That's not malice—it's just the complexity of freight billing. Different rates, surcharges, accessorial fees. Carriers make mistakes. And you're paying for them."

### SLIDE 2: The Instant Audit Wedge (Lead Generation Hook)

**Title:** "Here's How We Get You There: The Instant Audit"

**Tagline:** "Upload your last 90 days of invoices. We'll find the money in 24 hours. For free."

**What the Customer Sees:**
```
The Tesseract Instant Audit Process:

[Step 1]                    [Step 2]                    [Step 3]
Send Us 3 Months      →     We Process Everything   →   You Get Results

  THE OLD WAY               THE TESSERACT WAY
  30-60 days                24 hours
  Manual offshore teams      AI + minimal touch
  30-40% of errors found     90%+ of errors found
  50% of recovery            65% keep, 35% to Tesseract
  ```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's the thing that stops most companies from auditing: it's expensive and slow. With Tesseract, we've turned that upside down. You send us your invoices, we do the work overnight. By tomorrow morning, you know exactly what you're overpaying. No pressure. You're not obligated to use us. But once you see the numbers, you usually do."

### SLIDE 3: How It Works (The Product Story)

**Title:** "3 Simple Steps to Continuous Savings"

**Step 1: Ingest**
```
You: Forward invoices to invoices@tesseract.ai
Time: 30 seconds
Setup: Done. Email forwarding = automatic ingestion
```

**Step 2: Analyze**
```
Tesseract: AI audits each invoice in 60 seconds
- OCR reads invoice
- LLM extracts structured data
- ML model detects errors vs. your contracts
- Confidence scoring (high/medium/low)
```

**Step 3: Recover**
```
You: Generate dispute letter, review, send to carrier
Tesseract: Tracks dispute status, monitors carrier response
Carrier: Issues credit memo within 30-90 days
You: Get credit + Tesseract receives contingency fee
```

**Social Proof / Case Study Snippet:**
```
"ACME Manufacturing recovered $43K in 90 days"
- Annual freight spend: $8M
- Errors found: 47 over 90 days
- Disputes submitted: 12
- Win rate: 75%
- Total recovered: $7,850
- What this means: On track for $35K/year in recovery
```

**Dashboard Preview (Screenshot):**
- Show 3 key screens:
  1. Overview dashboard (total recoveries, open disputes, success rate)
  2. Invoice queue (list of flagged invoices, sortable by carrier/error type)
  3. Dispute detail view (side-by-side comparison: invoice vs. contract)

**Speaker Notes:**
"The workflow is dead simple. You don't change your invoice process at all. Just forward invoices like you always do. We handle the audit. You generate disputes. You get the credit. The reason this works is because we're using AI—GPT-4 for data extraction, custom ML for error detection—combined with your contract data. It's not magic, it's just fast."

- Average win rate: 80%
- Average ROI: 8:1
- Average payback: 1.8 months
```

**Visuals:**
- Bar chart: Recovery potential by customer
  ```
  Manufacturer A:  $35K
  Distributor B:   $12K
  Retailer C:     $150K

  Fuel errors: 20%
  Weight: 5%
  ```

**Speaker Notes:**
"These aren't hypothetical numbers. These are actual pilots we ran. And notice the ROI—we're talking 8:1 on average. That's because the errors are real, and they happen every month. Tesseract doesn't just find past mistakes. It prevents future ones by checking every invoice automatically."

### SLIDE 5: Why Now? Why Tesseract? (Urgency + Differentiation)

**Title:** "The Freight Audit Market Is Broken—We're Fixing It"

**The Old Way (Legacy Auditors)**
```
PROCESS:
- Contact company
- Send offshore team to manual review
- 30-60 day turnaround
- Charge 50% contingency fee
- You get: A PDF report (black box, you don't understand methodology)

RESULTS:
- Catch: 30-40% of errors
- Cost: 50% of recoveries
- Transparency: Low (where did these errors come from?)
- Speed: 30-60 days
- Scale: Limited (expensive, manual)

SENTIMENT: "This feels like they're taking half our money."
```

**The Tesseract Way**
```
PROCESS:
- Sign up online (5 minutes)
- Forward invoices (30 seconds setup)
- Dashboard shows results in real-time
- Charge 30-35% contingency (lower)
- You get: Full visibility into every error, every dispute, every recovery

RESULTS:
- Catch: 90%+ of errors
- Cost: 30-35% of recoveries
- Transparency: High (see exactly what we found and why)
- Speed: 24 hours to first results, real-time ongoing
- Scale: Unlimited (AI-powered, grows with you)

SENTIMENT: "This feels like a partnership, not a middleman."
```

**Why This Matters Now:**
1. **AI is Finally Ready:** GPT-4 can extract invoice data with 95%+ accuracy (was impossible 2 years ago)
2. **Carriers Are Digitizing:** More invoices → more data → bigger upside for automation
3. **Finance Teams Are Overwhelmed:** Post-pandemic freight volumes are 20-30% higher (more invoices to audit)
4. **Legacy Auditors Aren't Scaling:** Still using manual, offshore labor models (doesn't work at scale)

**Competitive Positioning:**
```
          Speed    Accuracy   Cost    Transparency   ROI
Tesseract  ⭐⭐⭐    ⭐⭐⭐      ⭐⭐⭐      ⭐⭐⭐         ⭐⭐⭐
Legacy     ⭐       ⭐⭐       ⭐       ⭐            ⭐⭐
Manual     ⭐       ⭐⭐       ⭐       ⭐⭐           ⭐
```

**Call-to-Action (Close):**
```
"Most companies are wasting $100K-$500K/year on freight overcharges.

You don't have to be one of them.

Here's what I suggest:
1. Spend 30 minutes sending us your last 90 days of invoices
2. Check back tomorrow for our audit results
3. See if the numbers make sense for a pilot

No cost. No commitment. No pressure.

Let's find the money that's already yours."

**Visuals:**
- Side-by-side comparison table (as shown above)
- Timeline chart (old way: 30-60 days, Tesseract way: 24 hours)
- ROI comparison graphic

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's what we realized: the freight audit industry hasn't changed in 20 years. Legacy companies still use offshore teams, manual review, weeks of turnaround. We said, 'What if we could do this in hours instead of days? What if we could find 90% of errors instead of 30%? What if we charged less because we have lower costs?'

That's Tesseract. We're not just better at the existing game. We're playing a different game. And we're winning."

## PART 5: CUSTOMER ACQUISITION STRATEGY

### Target Market Segmentation (Priority Order)

#### Segment 1: Mid-Market Manufacturers (Highest Priority)

**Profile:**
- Revenue: $100M-$1B annually
- Freight spend: $5M-$30M/year
- Freight invoice volume: 500-2,000/month
- Decision maker: CFO, VP Supply Chain
- Pain point: High volume, complex contracts, margin pressure

**Why They're First:**
- Large enough to have significant overcharges ($50K-$200K/year)
- Sophisticated enough to understand the value proposition
- Ready to adopt technology solutions
- Decision cycle: 30-60 days (faster than enterprise)

**Outreach Message:**
```
"Hi [Name], our analysis shows companies like [Acme Corp] 
in manufacturing lose $100K-$500K/year to freight overcharges. 
Your invoice volume suggests a similar opportunity.

Want a free audit of your last 90 days?"
```

**Sales Channels:**
- LinkedIn (target CFOs, procurement VPs)
- Cold email (via ZoomInfo/Apollo)
- Industry events (CSCMP, APics)
- Referrals from existing customers

**Success Metrics:**
- Target: 5-10 customers by end of Month 6

- Win rate: 20% of engaged prospects

---

#### Segment 2: 3PLs & Freight Brokers (Secondary)

**Profile:**
- 3PLs who pay carrier invoices on behalf of customers
- High invoice volume (5,000-10,000/month)
- Decision maker: Operations Manager, CFO
- Pain point: Manual reconciliation, customer disputes

**Why They Matter:**
- Massive invoice volume (higher recovery potential)
- Can white-label Tesseract for their customers
- Strategic partnership opportunity

**Outreach Message:**
```
"Hi [Name], if you manage freight invoices for customers, 
you probably spend 20%+ of your time on reconciliation.

Tesseract can automate that and generate new revenue 
through recovery services."
```

**Sales Channels:**
- LinkedIn (partnerships, not direct sales)
- Industry association (3PL council, TMS provider networks)
- Partnership with TMS providers (NetSuite, Oracle)

---

#### Segment 3: E-commerce & Retail (Tertiary)

**Profile:**
- High-volume, fast-growing companies
- Freight spend: $10M-$50M/year
- Invoice volume: 1,000-5,000/month
- Decision maker: COO, Logistics Director
- Pain point: Rapid growth, invoice volume overwhelming finance team

**Why They Matter:**
- Ready adopters of new technology
- Fast decision cycles
- Willing to pay for efficiency (SaaS model appeals to them)

**Outreach Message:**
```
"Hi [Name], growing fast is great until freight reconciliation 
becomes your bottleneck.

We've helped [Customer] process 5,000+ invoices/month without 
adding headcount."
```

---

### Sales Process (Repeatable Playbook)

#### Stage 1: Qualification Call (30 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Confirm company fits ideal customer profile
- Understand current state of freight audit/invoice reconciliation
- Qualify budget/decision-making authority
- Set expectations for discovery audit

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "How many freight invoices do you process per month?"
2. "Who currently audits these invoices (internal team, 3PL, manual)?"
3. "How much time does your team spend on this work?"
4. "What's your annual freight spend roughly?"
5. "Do you have contracts with major carriers (FedEx, UPS, XPO)?"
6. "Have you ever had a dispute with a carrier over invoice accuracy?"

**Qualification Criteria:**
- ✅ $2M+ annual freight spend (minimum)
- ✅ 200+ invoices/month (minimum)
- ✅ CFO or Supply Chain VP decision-maker
- ✅ Willing to try 2-week pilot (free)

**Outcomes:**
- Qualified → Schedule discovery audit
- Not qualified → Document for future (may grow into it)
- Unclear → Schedule follow-up call

**Note:** At this stage, emphasis is on **free discovery audit**, not selling a contract.

---

#### Stage 2: Discovery Audit (2 weeks, asynchronous)

**What Happens:**
- Customer sends 1-3 months of historical invoices (email or S3 upload)
- Customer uploads carrier contracts (PDFs or Excel)
- Tesseract processes invoices overnight
- Tesseract generates audit report with findings

**Deliverable (Audit Report):**
```
[Company Name] Freight Audit - Discovery Results

INVOICES PROCESSED: 450
ERRORS FOUND: 22
RECOVERY POTENTIAL: $12,500

TOP ERROR TYPES:
1. Overcharges vs. contract rate (45%): $5,625
2. Duplicate invoices (23%): $2,875
3. Unauthorized accessories (18%): $2,250
4. Fuel surcharge errors (14%): $1,750

ESTIMATED ANNUAL RUN RATE:
22 errors × 12 months = 264 errors/year
$12,500 × 12 = $150,000/year in recovery potential

NEXT STEPS:
Ready to discuss how we can make this recurring?
[Link to discovery meeting]
```

**Success Metric:**
- Report clearly shows $5K+ recovery potential (otherwise not worth pursuing)

---

#### Stage 3: Discovery Meeting (30 minutes)

**Attendees:**
- Customer: CFO or Supply Chain VP
- Tesseract: Sales + Product lead
- Optional: Customer's AP manager (executor)

**Agenda:**
1. **Results Review (10 min)**
   - Walk through audit findings
   - Explain what errors mean + why they matter
   - Show examples of specific invoice errors

2. **Solution Demo (10 min)**
   - Show dashboard
   - Explain workflow: ingest → analyze → dispute
   - Show how to submit a dispute

3. **Pilot Proposal (10 min)**
   - Explain pilot offer: "90-day free engagement, then convert to paid"
   - Offer options: contingency vs. SaaS (let customer choose)
   - Set expectations: weekly reports, bi-weekly calls

**Outcomes:**
- **Yes → Kickoff Pilot:** Sign pilot LOI, begin active onboarding
- **Maybe → Schedule Follow-up:** They need to review internally (normal)
- **No → Thank & Keep Warm:** Stay in touch, offer "annual re-audit"

---

#### Stage 4: Pilot Kickoff (1-2 weeks)

**Objectives:**
- Finalize data integration (email forwarding setup)
- Upload contracts
- Run historical audit
- Schedule recurring calls

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Kickoff call scheduled (all stakeholders)
- [ ] Email forwarding configured (test sent/received)
- [ ] Contracts uploaded (minimum 2)
- [ ] Historical audit completed (last 90 days processed)
- [ ] First weekly report sent

---

#### Stage 5: Pilot Execution (Months 2-3)

**Ongoing Activities:**

- Bi-weekly calls (review findings, discuss disputes)
- Monthly ML model refinements (custom rules)
- Monthly business review (results, ROI projection)

**Success Metrics (Weekly):**
- Processing 100% of new invoices without errors
- Extraction accuracy ≥90% (customer validates)
- Dashboard uptime ≥99.5%
- NPS ≥40 at 60-day mark

---

#### Stage 6: Conversion (Month 3, Week 9-12)

**Conversion Meeting (1 hour):**
- Final results review
- Project annual impact
- Present 2 contract options:
  1. **Contingency (lower risk):** 30-35% of recoveries
  2. **SaaS (predictable):** $6K-$15K/month depending on tier

**Pitch:**
```
"You've seen the data. Over 90 days, we found $[X] in 
recovery potential. At this rate, you're looking at $[Y]/year 
in overcharges.

Here's my recommendation:
- If you want to prove the model further: Stay on contingency
- If you want predictable pricing + 100% recovery capture: Move to SaaS

Either way, you're better off than you were before."
```

**Typical Outcome:**
- 70% choose contingency (lower risk, proven model)
- 30% choose SaaS (want predictable pricing, bigger upside)

**Close:**
- Sign 12-month contract
- Move to operations (ongoing support)
- Schedule first post-conversion business review

---

### Sales Compensation & Metrics

**Sales Rep Compensation (Month 5+):**
- **Base salary:** $50K/year (market rate for SaaS SDR)
- **Commission:** 10% of first-year ACV (paid upon contract signature)
  - Example: $40K ACV × 10% = $4K commission
  - At 2 deals/month, this adds $8K/month variable comp = $96K/year (total $146K)

**Sales Metrics (KPIs):**
- **Activity:** 10 discovery calls/week (qualification)
- **Conversion:** 30% of qualified prospects → pilot
- **Pilot-to-paid:** 70% of pilots → paid contract
- **ACV:** $30K-$50K (blended)
- **Sales Cycle:** 4-6 weeks (discovery → conversion)
- **CAC:** $5K-$7K per customer
- **LTV:CAC:** 8:1 (target)

## PART 7: RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANS

### Risk 1: Low AI Extraction Accuracy

**Impact:** If extraction accuracy drops below 90%, customers see poor results and churn

**Mitigation:**
- Invest heavily in LLM fine-tuning (in-house ML team)
- Implement human-in-the-loop review (QA team reviews 10% of extractions)
- Use ensemble models (GPT-4 + Claude + local model for consensus)
- Monthly accuracy tracking + public dashboard for customers

**Contingency Plan:**
- If accuracy stays <85% at Month 3: Pivot to "assisted audit" (AI-aided human review)
- Hire 2-3 contract freight auditors to supplement AI
- Charge slightly higher fees ($40%+ contingency) to cover labor costs

---

### Risk 2: Low Dispute Win Rate

**Impact:** If customers submit disputes but only win 50% (vs. 80% target), ROI becomes negative

**Mitigation:**
- Work with pilot customers to understand carrier playbooks
- Build "dispute playbook" (templates + evidence packages that work)
- Partner with freight consultants (who know how to negotiate)
- Implement ML model to predict win probability (only auto-submit high-confidence disputes)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If win rate stays <70% after Month 3: Switch from contingency to SaaS-only model
- Shift value prop from "we recover money" to "we identify opportunities" (let customers negotiate)
- Lower contingency fee to 20% (cover operational costs, let customers keep 80%)

---

### Risk 3: Customers Don't Submit Disputes

**Impact:** Even if we find errors, customers don't bother submitting disputes (too much friction)

**Mitigation:**
- Make dispute submission one-click (auto-generate, customer just "approves")
- Offer "concierge service" (Tesseract team submits on customer's behalf)
- Show ROI in real-time (dashboard shows "you have $50K waiting to be recovered")
- Success fee instead of contingency (pay us only if you dispute)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If pilot disputes drop below 20% after Month 2: Offer "done-for-you" disputes
- Hire 1 FTE customer success manager to submit disputes on customer's behalf
- Charge 40% contingency (vs. 35%) to cover extra labor

---

### Risk 4: Slow Market Adoption

**Impact:** Can't get 10 design partners, takes 6+ months to find first customers

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize "free audit" (zero risk, high response rate)
- Partner with industry associations (3PL council, APICS chapters)
- Get early wins + publish case studies aggressively
- Leverage existing networks (investors' connections, employee referrals)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If pilots are slow to convert by Month 2: Pivot to white-label model
- Offer Tesseract platform to TMS providers / freight consultants as white-label
- Let them resell to their customer base (faster distribution)
- Reduce contingency fee to 50/50 partnership (split upside with partner)

---

### Risk 5: Pricing Too High or Too Low

**Impact:** Either can't acquire customers (too high) or poor margins (too low)

**Mitigation:**
- Validate pricing with first 5 pilots (ask "would you pay $X/month for this?")
- Monitor LTV:CAC ratio (should stay ≥8:1)
- Adjust SaaS pricing based on customer feedback (may need to lower in Month 4-5)
- Use value-based pricing (charge % of recoveries found, not recoveries kept)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If contingency fees are seen as too high (>40% customer friction): Switch to flat fee for SaaS
  - Instead of: "35% of recoveries"
  - Try: "$9K/month, we keep what we find"
- If SaaS adoption is slow: Offer longer trial periods (30 days free) or freemium tier
